                    <h2>CASE-:-</h2>
                    <p> .Rankin, C.J:- This is a husband’s petition for dissolution of marriage on the
                        ground of the adultery of the wife. The learned district judge of Darjeeling has
                        granted a decree of divorce and the facts appear to be borne out by the evidence
                        so far as the merits of the case are concerned. It is necessary however to point
                        out to the learned District judge that he has not properly dealt with the question
                        of domicile of the parties. Unless the parties are of Indian domicile, they do not
                        come under the jurisdiction conferred by the Indian Divorce Act, but under a
                        different jurisdiction altogether. In his petition the husband alleges that he was
                        born in British India and has always resided there and is at present residing at
                        Kalimpong. In his evidence, he says: “I am a Christian; I was born in the
                        Dooars, British India”. This Court has pointed out before, for the benefit of the
                        learned District Judges, that evidence such as this is not proper evidence of
                        domicile. There are many Europeans who are born in British India but are not of
                        Indian domicile. It is necessary to have regard to the circumstances and to
                        carefully enquire on proper legal principles into the question of domicile. It may
                        be quite plain that these parties belong to the domiciled community. All I can
                        say is that there is no evidence of that. Nothing appears from the name
                        Cresswell which is an ordinary European name. The learned District Judge has
                        exercised a jurisdiction without having proper proof that he is entitled to
                        exercise it. <br>
                        2. I may add that this defect in the treatment of divorce cases is constantly
                        causing trouble and I must really ask the District judges to appreciate the rulings
                        on this subject of domicile [Wright v. Wright 2 and Stroud v. Stroud 3 ] and to
                        take care to see that in all cases there is proper proof of Indian domicile before
                        giving a decree under the Indian Divorce Act. <br>
                        3. The case must be sent back to the learned District Judge for further enquiry
                        on this point. He will take such additional evidence as may be necessary and
                        certify its result to this court. <br>
                        Buckland, J.:- I agree. <br>
                        Costello, J.:- I agree. <br> <br>
                        4. Case remanded.
