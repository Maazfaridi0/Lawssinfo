                    <h2>ABSTRACT:-</h2>
                    <p>In this paper tries to discuss on the provisions of live in relationships in India. <br> <br>
                        Live-in-relationship is valid in India. According to Article 21 of Indian constitution i.e.
                        Protection of life and personal liberty, every person has freedom to choose their life partner
                        with the way of marriage or any other suitable way and article 21 of Indian constitution also
                        provide freedom to couples to live in relationships as the couples get much time to know each
                        other well before getting married or making a decision to live whole life together. But as a
                        coin has two faces live-in relationship also has two phases i.e., positive and negative.

                    <h2>INTRODUCTION:-</h2>
                    <p>In India development of people and our country is on the peak. Everything is changing with the
                        time very rapidly. India is well known for its religious practices all over the world. Our
                        traditions and customs are being followed in today's time also. Our customs says that a
                        relationship is incomplete without the tag of “marriage”. Today more than 30% of people are
                        living in live in relationship in India. Our culture promotes a valid marriage rather than
                        live-in-relationships as live-in-relationships are only for self enjoyment, understanding the
                        nature of the partner and pleasure, they don't have rights and liabilities for their partners.
                        It doesn't require any legal proceedings to get separate from the partner. A man doesn't have
                        any responsibilities towards the woman. He can leave her without her consent anytime or at any
                        place and vice-versa. The woman doesn't get any legal status in the society as a wife gets by a
                        valid marriage.
                    </p>

                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>MEANING:-</h2>
                    <p>Live-in-relationship is a relationship in which two people i.e. man and woman reside at a same
                        place for a period of time without getting married. There is no codified law in India for
                        unmarried couples who are in live-in-relationships. In a live-in-relationship man and woman
                        doesn't require any divorce or legal proceedings for separation.

                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>POSITIVE IMPACTS OF LIVE-IN-RELATIONSHIP:-</h2>
                    <p> 1- To test the compatibility before they commit to a legal union. <br>
                        2- To maintain their single status for financial reasons. <br>
                        3- Most of couples go for live-in-relations because they hate to be divorced.

                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF LIVE-IN-RELATIONSHIP:-</h2>
                    <p> 1- Lack of support from families and friends. <br>
                        2- Lack of commitment <br>
                        3- In India couples do not get that much respect as they can achieve by getting married. <br>
                        4- SHRADDHA WALKER MURDER CASE: shraddha and Aaftaab were in a live in relationship since two
                        years. Aaftaab strangled his girlfriend shraddha and chopped her body into 35 pieces and
                        disposed of them in different parts of mehrauli (Delhi).

                    <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF LIVE-IN-RELATIONSHIP IN INDIA:-</h2>
                    <p> Though 'Live in relationship' term may seem distasteful to some, nonetheless it is practice
                        prevalent since ancient times. The purans also have a mention of Gandharva marriage which does
                        not require involvement of the family members in the rituals. Even lord Krishna and radha lived
                        together according to mythology.

                    <h2>BADRI PRASAD VS. DY DIRECTOR OF CONSOLIDATION (1978):</h2>
                    <p>For around 50 years, a man and a woman, as the facts in this case unfold, lived as husband and
                        wife. An adventurist challenge to the factum of marriage between the two, by the petitioner in
                        this special leave petition, has been negative by the High Court. A strong presumption arises in
                        favors of wedlock where the partners have lived together for a long spell as husband and wife.
                        Although the presumption is rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him who seeks to deprive the
                        relationship of legal origin. Law leans in favors of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy. In
                        this view, the contention of Shri Garg, for the petitioner, that long after the alleged
                        marriage, evidence has not been produced to sustain its ceremonial processes by examining the
                        priest or other witnesses, deserves no consideration. If men and women who live as husband and
                        wife in society are compelled to prove, half a century later, by eyewitness evidence that they
                        were validly married, few will succeed. The contention deserves to be negative and we do so
                        without hesitation. The special leave petitions are dismissed.

                    <h2>UNMARRIED COUPLES - RIGHTS IN INDIA</h2>
                    <p> There is no codified law for unmarried couples or whom marriage is not completed. But there are
                        several women who face many problems while having incomplete marriage or live-in-relationship.
                        <br> <br>
                        According to report of 2003 of reforms of criminal justice system it was observed that evidence
                        regarding a man and woman living together for a sufficiency long period should be enough to draw
                        the presumption that the marriage was performed according to the customary rites and ceremonies
                        of the parties. And thus, it is proposed that the word wife in section 125 CR.P.C. should be
                        altered to include a woman who was living with man like his wife for a reasonably protracted
                        period. It was also observed that the word wife needs some important changes also. <br> <br>
                        It is judgment that law will presume where boy and girl are living together for a period of
                        time. And that relation is open to all and consists some evidences also. In a case of Marvin v.
                        Marvin court used a new expression of ‘palimony’ has been coined, which is a combination of ‘pal
                        and ‘alimony’ for social obligation of a man entering into a live-in-relationship with another
                        woman, without the formalities of marriage. And it was held that the provision of the family law
                        act does not govern a non-marital relationship; such as a relationship remains subject solely to
                        judicial decision. <br> <br>
                        The Supreme Court ruled that live-in relationships are lawful and two adults living together
                        cannot be regarded as illegal or unconstitutional. <br> <br>
                        • Unmarried couples have the right to roam and sit together in public places as long as no
                        “obscene act” takes place. <br>
                        • If a live-in couple has resided under the same roof for some years, then any child born to
                        them will not be illegitimate. The Supreme Court decided that children born to a live-in couple
                        are legitimate. <br>
                        • Unmarried couples engaging in consensual sex in private places cannot be harassed by the
                        police. The right to privacy includes sexual autonomy and also protects unmarried couples. <br>
                        • There is no law forbidding unmarried couples from renting or buying a home together. Unmarried
                        couples can live together and buy or rent a property and become joint owners. <br>
                        • The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 also includes the right of partners
                        in a live-in relationship to receive protection from domestic violence and abusive
                        relationships.

                    <h2>STATUS OF A CHILD BORN IN A LIVE-IN-RELATIONSHIP:-</h2>
                    <p> A child born in live-in-relationship is considered as a legitimate child in India. He/she have
                        all the same rights and liabilities if they were born out of a valid marriage. The child will be
                        considered as legal heir and will have all the rights in his father’s property. <br> <br>
                        In case of Bharatha matha vs. R Vijay renganathan & ors (2010) :- <br> <br>
                        It was held by hon’ble Supreme Court that a child born in a live-in-relationship will be
                        considered legitimate children and will be allowed share in ancestral property.

                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>CONCLUSION:-</h2>
                    <p>Observing all the above facts live-in-relationship is that, these types of relationships are grey
                        shade. They have both good and bad impacts on our life. As stated above India is well known for
                        its culture worldwide. According to Indian society many people do not accept
                        live-in-relationship and if we see our Indian Marriage Act it also says that a man and women who
                        are in a live-in-relationship are not considered as husband and wife. To make a relationship
                        good or bad it only depends upon the people who are in such type of relationship, a man and
                        woman together makes a relationship good or bad.
