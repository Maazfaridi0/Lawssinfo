                    <p>
                        The urge to act in support of a goal is what motivates people. It is essential to
                        establishing and achieving our goals. <br>
                        One of the factors influencing human behaviour is motivation. It encourages
                        rivalry and fosters interpersonal relationships. Depression and other mental
                        diseases might result from its absence. The desire to keep making progress
                        toward a life with meaning, purpose, and worth living is a component of
                        motivation. <br>
                        People may have several reasons for acting in any given way. Extrinsic
                        motivation occurs when someone is motivated by things outside of themselves,
                        such as other people or prizes. Another type of motivation is intrinsic, where the
                        drive to get better at something originates from within. People are more likely to
                        push themselves harder and produce more satisfying results when they are
                        motivated from within.

                    <h2>INTRODUCTION:-</h2>
                    <p>Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, created the hierarchy of needs in
                        1943. It is one paradigm used to analyse motivation. Maslow argues that people
                        are naturally driven to improve themselves and progress toward realising their
                        full potential, or self-actualization, as they gradually meet and satisfy various
                        levels of need, ranging from the most basic ones, like the need for food and
                        safety, to higher-order ones, like the need for love, belonging, and self-esteem. <br> <br>
                        Maslow eventually expanded the theory to include a desire for self-
                        transcendence: By focusing on things outside of oneself, people can reach their
                        highest level of development and discover the meaning in life. Many people
                        think Maslow's theory reflects essential facts about human drive, despite
                        challenges to its universality. <br> <br>
                        When motivation and incentives are lacking, you either achieve no results or
                        only poor ones; but, when motivation is there, you produce greater and better
                        results and achievements.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>What exactly is motivation, and how does it impact how people behave?-</h2>
                    <p>Compare a student who struggles with motivation and studies infrequently to
                        one who is highly motivated and puts in numerous hours of study time. The
                        grades each student receives will be wholly unique. <br> <br>

                        Lack of motivation equates to a lack of excitement, zest, incentive, and
                        ambition, whereas having motivation indicates a strong desire, energy, and
                        enthusiasm as well as the readiness to put up the necessary effort to accomplish
                        one's goals.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>Types of Motivations-</h2>
                    <p> According to research, there are two categories of motivation:

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>Intrinsic motivation:</h2>
                    <p> It involves doing action even when there are no clear external benefits. You
                        engage in it because you find it interesting, pleasurable, and worthwhile. You
                        perform something without any external motivation or pressure, such as a
                        reward or deadline.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>Extrinsic motivation:</h2>
                    <p> It is behaviour that is motivated by outside rewards. The rewards may be
                        material, like cash or a gift, or intangible, like acclaim, a place in society, or
                        status. <br> <br>
                        Desire and ambition fuel motivation, thus when they are lacking, motivation
                        suffers as well.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
                    <p> Motivation can occasionally be stimulated by outside influences, such as a pep
                        talk, a movie, a book about successful individuals, or an event. These elements
                        arouse the drive to act, pursue a dream, or just complete a task. <br> <br>
                        These drivers or catalysts can be powerful and energising, propelling you
                        onward until you complete your intended task. When the trigger eventually
                        wears off, you may need another dose of motivating stimuli. <br> <br>
                        You may have the desire to get something done or reach a specific goal, but if
                        the desire and ambition are not strong enough, you will lack the drive, initiative,
                        and willingness to take the necessary action. <br> <br>
                        In these situations, there is a dearth of inner drive and motivation, and you must
                        somehow reawaken them.
