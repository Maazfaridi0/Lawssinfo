                        <h2>Constitutional rights</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the Constitution of India from 1950, articles 14-16, 19(1)(c), 23-24, 38, and 41-43A directly
                        concern labour rights. Article 14 states everyone should be equal before the law, article 15
                        specifically says the state should not discriminate against citizens, and article 16 extends a
                        right of "equality of opportunity" for employment or appointment under the state. Article
                        19(1)(c) gives everyone a specific right "to form associations or unions". Article 23 prohibits
                        all trafficking and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in
                        a factory, mine or "any other hazardous employment".
                        Articles 38-39, and 41-43A, however, like all rights listed in Part IV of the Constitution are
                        not enforceable by courts, rather than creating an aspirational "duty of the State to apply
                        these principles in making laws".[5] The original justification for leaving such principles
                        unenforceable by the courts was that democratically accountable institutions ought to be left
                        with discretion, given the demands they could create on the state for funding from general
                        taxation, although such views have since become controversial. Article 38(1) says that in
                        general the state should "strive to promote the welfare of the people" with a "social order in
                        which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of national
                        life. In article 38(2) it goes on to say the state should "minimise the inequalities in income"
                        and based on all other statuses. Article 41 creates a "right to work", which the National Rural
                        Employment Guarantee Act 2005 attempts to put into practice. Article 42 requires the state to
                        "make provision for securing just and human conditions of work and for maternity relief".
                        Article 43 says workers should have the right to a living wage and "conditions of work ensuring
                        a decent standard of life". Article 43A, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the
                        Constitution of India in 1976,[6] creates a constitutional right to codetermination by requiring
                        the state to legislate to "secure the participation of workers in the management of
                        undertakings" </p>

                    <p>
                        Scope of protection
                        See also: Taxation in India and Labour in India
                        Indian labour law makes a distinction between people who work in "organised" sectors and people
                        working in "unorganised sectors".[citation needed] The laws list the ditors to which various
                        labour rights apply. People who do not fall within these sectors, the ordinary law of contract
                        applies.[citation needed]

                        India's labour laws underwent a major update in the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947.[7] Since
                        then, an additional 45 national laws expand or intersect with the 1948 act, and another 200
                        state laws control the relationships between the worker and the company. These laws mandate all
                        aspects of employer-employee interaction, such as companies must keep 6 attendance logs, 10
                        different accounts for overtime wages, and file 5 types of annual returns. The scope of labour
                        laws extend from regulating the height of urinals in workers' washrooms to how often a work
                        space must be lime-washed.[8] Inspectors can examine working space anytime and declare fines for
                        violation of any labour laws and regulations.

                        Employment contracts
                        See also: Employment contract
                        Among the employment contracts that are regulated in India, the regulation involves significant
                        government involvement which is rare in developed countries. The Industrial Employment (Standing
                        Orders) Act 1946 requires that employers have terms including working hours, leave, productivity
                        goals, dismissal procedures or worker classifications, approved by a government body. The
                        employment agreement is also governed by the suitable confidentiality, non-disclosure agreement
                        (NDA) and non-compete clause (NCC) in agreements with employees.[9] It has its roots in trade
                        secret legislations under common law [10] and intellectual property law.[11] These may include
                        the type of information that is likely to be disclosed, the manner in which it should be used
                        and restrictions on disclosure post-termination.

                        The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 aims at regulating employment of
                        contract labour so as to place it at par with labour employed directly.[12] Women are now
                        permitted to work night shifts too (10 pm to 6 am).[12]

                        The Latin phrase 'dies non' is being widely used by disciplinary authorities in government and
                        industries for denoting the 'unauthorised absence' to the delinquent employees. According to
                        Shri R. P. Saxena, chief engineer, Indian Railways, dies-non is a period which neither counted
                        in service nor considered as break in service.[13] A person can be marked dies-non, if

                        absent without proper permission
                        when on duty left without proper permission
                        while in office but refused to perform duties
                        In cases of such willful and unauthorised absence from work, the leave sanctioning authority may
                        decide and order that the days on which the work is not performed be treated as dies non-on the
                        principle of no work no pay. This will be without prejudice to any other action that the
                        competent authority might take against the persons resorting to such practises.[14] The
                        principle of "no work no pay" is widely being used in the banking industry in India.[15] All
                        other manufacturing industries and large service establishments like railways, posts and
                        telecommunications are also implementing it to minimise the incidences of unauthorised absence
                        of workers. The term 'industry' infuses a contractual relationship between the employer and the
                        employee for sale of products and services which are produced through their cooperative
                        endeavor.

                        This contract together with the need to put in efforts in producing goods and services imposes
                        duties (including ancillary duties) and obligations on the part of the employees to render
                        services with the tools provided and in a place and time fixed by the employer. And in return,
                        as a quid pro quo, the employer is enjoined to pay wages for work done and or for fulfilling the
                        contract of employment. Duties generally, including ancillary duties, additional duties, normal
                        duties, emergency duties, which have to be done by the employees and payment of wages therefor.
                        Where the contract of employment is not fulfilled or work is not done as prescribed, the
                        principle of 'no work no pay' is brought into play.

                        In the Labour Law 2021, the government has approved an overtime payment to the employees working
                        more than 15 minutes of scheduled shift. It is applicable from 1 April 2021.

                        Wage regulation
                        See also: Minimum Wages Act 1948; Code on Wages, 2019; and Minimum wage
                        The Payment of Wages Act 1936 requires that employees receive wages, on time, and without any
                        unauthorised deductions. Section 6 requires that people are paid in money rather than in kind.
                        The law also provides the tax withholdings the employer must deduct and pay to the central or
                        state government before distributing the wages.[16]

                        The Minimum Wages Act 1948 sets wages for the different economic sectors that it states it will
                        cover. It leaves a large number of workers unregulated. Central and state governments have
                        discretion to set wages according to kind of work and location, and they range between as much
                        as ₹ 143 to 1120 per day for work in the so-called central sphere. State governments have their
                        own minimum wage schedules.[17]

                        The Payment of Gratuity Act 1972 applies to establishments with 10 or more workers. Gratuity is
                        payable to the employee if he or she resigns or retires. The Indian government mandates that
                        this payment be at the rate of 15 days salary of the employee for each completed year of service
                        subject to a maximum of ₹ 2000000.[18]

                        The Payment of Bonus Act 1965, which applies only to enterprises with over 20 people, requires
                        bonuses are paid out of profits based on productivity. The minimum bonus is currently 8.33 per
                        cent of salary.[19]

                        Health and safety
                        The Workmen's Compensation Act 1923 requires that compensation is paid if workers are injured in
                        the course of employment for injuries, or benefits to dependants. The rates are low.[22][23]

                        The Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 (repealed in 2020) created
                        the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation of India. This functions as a pension fund for old
                        age security for the organised workforce sector. For those workers, it creates Provident Fund to
                        which employees and employers contribute equally, and the minimum contributions are 10-12 per
                        cent of wages. On retirement, employees may draw their pension.[24]

                        by the Employees' State Insurance Act 1948.[25]

                        The Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act 2008 (repealed in 2020) was passed to extend the
                        coverage of life and disability benefits, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection
                        for unorganised workers. "Unorganised" is defined as home-based workers, self-employed workers
                        or daily-wage workers. The state government was meant to formulate the welfare system through
                        rules produced by the National Social Security Board.

                        The Maternity Benefit Act 1961 (repealed in 2020), creates rights to payments of maternity
                        benefits for any woman employee who worked in any establishment for a period of at least 80 days
                        during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery.[26] On 30 March
                        2017 the President of India Pranab Mukherjee approved the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act,
                        2017 which provides for 26-weeks paid maternity leave for women employees.

                        or for his/her dependents in case of employee's early death. It extends to the whole of India
                        except the State of Jammu and Kashmir and is applicable to:

                        every factory engaged in any industry specified in Schedule 1 in which 20 or more persons are
                        employed.
                        every other establishment employing 20 or more persons or class of such establishments that the
                        Central Govt. may notify.

                        However, like other rights in Part IV, this article is not directly enforceable but instead
                        creates a duty upon state organs to implement its principles through legislation (and
                        potentially through court cases). In 1978 the Sachar Report recommended legislation for
                        inclusion of workers on boards, however this had not yet been implemented.[30]

                        The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 section 3 created a right of participation in joint work
                        councils to "provide measures for securing amity and good relations between the employer and
                        workmen and, to that end to comment upon matters of their common interest or concern and
                        endeavour to compose any material difference of opinion in respect of such matters". However,
                        trade unions had not taken up these options on a large scale. In National Textile Workers Union
                        v Ramakrishnan[31] the Supreme Court, Bhagwati J giving the leading judgment, held that
                        employees had a right to be heard in a winding up petition of a company because their interests
                        were directly affected and their standing was not excluded by the wording of the Companies Act
                        1956 section 398. It is repealed by the Industrial Relations Code, 2020.

                        The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 regulates how employers may address industrial disputes such as
                        lockouts, layoffs, retrenchment etc. It controls the lawful processes for reconciliation,
                        adjudication of labour disputes. According to fundamental rules (FR 17A) of the civil service of

                        other employees as a result of action in combination or in concerted manner, such as during a
                        strike, without any authority from, or valid reason to the satisfaction of the competent
                        authority; shall be deemed to cause an interruption or break in the service of the employee,
                        unless otherwise decided by the competent authority for the purpose of leave travel concession,
                        quasi-permanency and eligibility for appearing in departmental examinations, for which a minimum
                        period of continuous service is required.[32]

                        opportunity" for employment or appointment under the state. Article 23 prohibits all trafficking
                        and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in a factory, mine
                        or "any other hazardous employment".

                        Gender discrimination

                        work. In the Equal Remuneration Act 1976 implemented this principle in legislation.

                        Randhir Singh v Union of India Supreme Court of India held that the principle of equal pay for
                        equal work is a constitutional goal and therefore capable of enforcement through constitutional
                        remedies under Article 32 of Constitution
                        State of AP v G Sreenivasa Rao, equal pay for equal work does not mean that all the members of
                        the same cadre must receive the same pay packet irrespective of their seniority, source of
                        recruitment, educational qualifications and various other incidents of service.

                        gender identity in employment. Furthermore, the following judicial orders ban discrimination on
                        the basis of sexual orientation in employment.

                    <p>Fair dismissal
                        See also: Unfair dismissal
                        Some of India's most controversial labour laws concern the procedures for dismissal contained in
                        the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. A workman who has been employed for over a year can only be
                        dismissed if permission is sought from and granted by the appropriate government office.[37]
                        Additionally, before dismissal, valid reasons must be given, and there is a wait of at least two
                        months for government permission, before a lawful termination can take effect.

                        A permanent worker can be terminated only for proven misconduct or for habitual absence.[38] The
                        Industrial Disputes Act (1947) requires companies employing more than 100 workers to seek
                        government approval before they can fire employees or close down.[12] In practice, permissions
                        for firing employees are seldom granted.[12] Indian laws require a company to get permission for
                        dismissing workers with plant closing, even if it is necessary for economic reasons. The
                        government may grant or deny permission for closing, even if the company is losing money on the
                        operation.[39]

                        The dismissed worker has a right to appeal, even if the government has granted the dismissal
                        application. Indian labour regulations provide for a number of appeal and adjudicating
                        authorities – conciliation officers, conciliation boards, courts of inquiry, labour courts,
                        industrial tribunals and the national industrial tribunal – under the Industrial Disputes
                        Act.[40] These involve complex procedures. Beyond these labour appeal and adjudicating
                        procedures, the case can proceed to respective State High Court or finally the Supreme Court of
                        India.

                        Bharat Forge Co Ltd v Uttam Manohar Nakate [2005] INSC 45, a worker found sleeping for the
                        fourth time in 1983. Bharat Forge initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Industrial
                        Employment Act (1946). After five months of proceedings, the worker was found guilty and
                        dismissed. The worker appealed to the labour court, pleading that his dismissal was unfair under
                        Indian Labour laws. The labour court sided with the worker, directed he be reinstated, with 50%
                        back wages. The case went through several rounds of appeal and up through India's court system.
                        After 22 years, the Supreme Court of India upheld his dismissal in 2005.[41][42]
                        Redundancy
                        Redundancy pay must be given, set at 15 days' average pay for each complete year of continuous
                        service. An employee who has worked for 4 years in addition to various notices and due process,
                        must be paid a minimum of the employee's wage equivalent to 60 days before retrenchment, if the
                        government grants the employer a permission to lay off.

                        Main article: Unemployment in India
                        National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005
                        The Industries (Regulation and Development) Act 1951 declared that manufacturing industries
                        under its First Schedule were under common central government regulations in addition to
                        whatever laws state government enact. It reserved over 600 products that can only be
                        manufactured in small-scale enterprises, thereby regulating who can enter in these businesses,
                        and above all placing a limit on the number of employees per company for the listed products.
                        The list included all key technology and industrial products in the early 1950s, including
                        products ranging from certain iron and steel products, fuel derivatives, motors, certain
                        machinery, machine tools, to ceramics and scientific equipment.[43]</p>
