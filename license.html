                    <h2>ABSTRACT:-</h2>
                    <p>In this article author discuss about the licenses.. <br> <br>
                        In Chapter VI of THE INDIAN EASEMENT ACT,1882, License is defined. Is there a law
                        for licensing? There is a licensing law but it is specifically used in some cases. The
                        privileges
                        or special rights of the licensee may be terminated at will if a licensor does not give cause to
                        expect. The license under the Transfer of Property Act means permission to enter or use the
                        property of another.

                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>INTRODUCTION:-</h2>
                    <p>According to Black’s Law Dictionary-; License is the context of property law as an authority
                        to do a particular act or series of act upon another’s land without possessing and estate
                        therein. Whereas, <br> <br>
                        According to Oxford Dictionary of Law-; License is the permission to enter or occupy a
                        person’s land for an agreed purpose.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>MEANING:-</h2>
                    <p>According to section 52 of THE INDIAN EASEMENT ACT,1882. License is “where one
                        person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue
                        to
                        do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence
                        of such right, by unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the
                        property, the right is called a license.” <br> <br>
                        The person who grant license are known as “licensor”. And, the person who received license
                        known as “licensee”.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>Now, the question arises, who may grant license? And, whether this grant may
                        be express or implied?P:-</h2>
                    <p>A license may be granted by anyone in the circumstances and to the extent in and to which he
                        may transfer his interests in the property affected by the license. And, the grant of a license
                        may be express or implied from the conduct of the grantor, and an agreement which purpose
                        to create an easement, but is ineffectual for that purpose, may operate to create a license.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF LICENSE:-</h2>
                    <p> The essentials are as follows: <br>
                        1. There are two different persons. <br>
                        2. There has to be grant. <br>

                        3. License is always useful. <br>
                        4. License is granted to something in or upon the granters immovable property. <br>
                        5. License does not relate to ownership of any land but only creates a personal right or
                        obligations.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>DUTIES OF GRANTOR’S-</h2>
                    <p>There are several duties of grantor’s but among them only three duties are most important: <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Grantor’s duty to disclose defects. <br>
                        2. Grantor’s duty not to render property unsafe. <br>
                        3. Grantor’s transferee not bound by license. <br> <br>

                        Means, the grantor of a license is bound to disclose to the licensee any defect in the property
                        affected by the license, likely to be dangerous to the person or property of the licensee, of
                        which the grantor is, and the licensee is not, aware. The grantor of a license is bound not to
                        do anything likely to render the property affected by the license dangerous to the person or
                        property of the licensee. And, when the grantor of the license transfers the property affected
                        thereby, the transferee is not as such bound by the license.


                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="liveincontent" id="love">
                    <h2>WHEN IS THE LICENSE TRANSFERABLE?</h2>
                    <p> Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a license granted by the
                        licensor to licensee cannot be exercised by the other person, it can only be exercised by the
                        person, to whom the license is granted. OR, a license to attend a place of public entertainment
                        may be transferred by the licensee; but, save as aforesaid, a license cannot he transferred by
                        the licensee or exercised by his servants or agents. <br> <br>
                        EXAMPLE: <br> <br>
                        The Government grant B a license to erect and use temporary grain-sheds
                        on government land. In the absence of express provision to the contrary, B’s
                        servants may enter on the land for the purpose of erecting sheds, erect the same,
                        deposit grain therein and remove grain therefrom.

                    <h2>REVOCATION OF LICENSE-</h2>
                    <p>A license is deemed to be revoked: <br> <br>
                        a. When, from a cause preceding the grant of it, the grantor ceases to have any interest in
                        the property affected by the license. <br>
                        b. When the licensee releases it, expressly or impliedly, to the grantor or his
                        representative. <br>
                        c. Where it has been granted for a limited period, or acquired on condition that it shall
                        become void on the performance or non-performance of a specified act, and the
                        period expires, or the condition is fulfilled. <br>
                        d. Where the property affected by the license is destroyed or by superior force so
                        permanently altered that the license can no longer exercise his right. <br>
                        e. Where the licensee becomes entitled to the absolute ownership of the property
                        affected by the license. <br>
                        f. Where the license is granted for a specified purpose and the purpose is attained, or
                        abandoned, or becomes impracticable. <br>

                        years, and such cessation is not in pursuance of a contract between the grantor and the
                        licensee. <br>
                        i. In the case of an accessory license, when the interest or right to which it is accessory
                        ceases to exist.

                    <h2>CONCLUSION--</h2>
                    <p>According to the arguments above, a licence is simply permission to do something on real
                        estate, such as occupying it, enjoying it, or using it for another purpose. It is a written
                        version
                        of a contract between the licensee and the grantor. It resembles one person giving another
                        their consent or the authority to do something. A licence cannot be given away or transferred.
                        The aforementioned fact does not imply that the phrase &quot;licence&quot; is exempt from
                        licence
                        regulations. There is a licence statute, however it is only applied in certain circumstances. If
                        a
                        licensee is not given a reason to expect it, the privileges or special rights may be revoked at
                        any time. The license under the Transfer of Property Act means Permission to enter or use the
                        property of another.
